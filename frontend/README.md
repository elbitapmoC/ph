This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

Create a React frontend powered by the given Node.js backend that allows users to view, create, and update patients and prescriptions. There are two groups of users that will interact with this tool, `Providers` and `Pharmacist's`

### Requirements

- This front end should make use of the [Chakra UI library](https://chakra-ui.com/) for design and components
- Both users, Providers and Pharmacists, should be able to complete their respective actions:

**Provider**

As a provider, I should be able to create new patients and write prescriptions for these patients. I would also like to see my other patients and the status of their previously written prescriptions

**Pharmacist**

As a pharmacist, I should be able to see all prescriptions and move them through the different states (pending, in progress, and filled).

### Backend Guide

In order to run the backend, you must follow these steps:

1. [Ensure npm and node.js are installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
2. Once installed, run `npm install` within the backend directory to install the required dependencies
3. Afterwards, run `npm run start` and the backend server should be reachable at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
